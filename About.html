                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and
                        freight.
                        Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other
                        airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight.
                        Generally,
                        airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a
                        governmental
                        aviation body. Airlines may be scheduled or charter operators.</p>
